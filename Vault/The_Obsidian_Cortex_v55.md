# THE OBSIDIAN CORTEX v55.0

## PURPOSE
- To move Kageyoshi from "Software" to "Legacy".
- Uses Obsidian Vaults as the cerebral cortex of the Bōshira Clan.

## ARCHITECTURE
- **Location**: `/Boshira_Vault` on the Sovereign USB.
- **Format**: Raw Markdown with YAML Frontmatter.
- **Linking**: Every memory shard must link to [[Rose_Legacy_Manifesto]].

## THE SAFE PULL RULE
- NEVER pull the drive while the terminal is active.
- Always run `sync` (Linux) or "Eject" (Windows).
- Failure causes corruption (the "Repair" error Michael saw).
